# 🌍 Web-to-Audio Converter 🎙️

A powerful and versatile **Web-to-Audio Converter** that extracts text from web articles (HTML or PDF), summarizes content, and converts it into high-quality speech using **Gradio**, **Transformers**, and **Kokoro TTS**.

---

## 📖 About the Project
The **Web-to-Audio Converter** is designed to simplify content consumption by turning lengthy web articles, PDFs, and documents into clear, engaging audio.

Whether you're a researcher, a student, or someone who prefers listening over reading, this app offers a seamless way to consume content efficiently.

This application leverages state-of-the-art NLP models like **BART**, **GLiNER**, and **Kokoro TTS** for advanced text processing, summarization, and audio generation.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
### 🔍 1. Text Extraction & Cleaning
- Extracts text from **HTML** and **PDF** URLs.
- Uses **Trafilatura** for web scraping and **MarkItDown** for PDF conversion.
- Metadata such as author, publication date, and keywords are automatically extracted.
- Cleans extracted text by:
  - Removing excessive white spaces.
  - Removing unwanted content like references, links, and unnecessary comments.
- Automatically identifies the **language** of the extracted text.

---

### 📋 2. Summarization
- Powered by **Facebook's BART Large CNN** model for high-quality text summarization.
- Handles **large documents** using an optimized chunking strategy that preserves content flow.
- Generates concise summaries with clear, structured highlights.

---

### 🗣️ 3. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Uses **Kokoro TTS** for high-quality voice synthesis.
- Supports multiple languages:
  - **English**, **French**, **Hindi**, **Italian**, and **Portuguese**.
- Offers a variety of voice styles to suit different content types (e.g., storytelling, documentaries, etc.).
- Provides the option to generate audio from:
  - **Summarized content** for concise narration.
  - **Original raw content** for full-length audio playback.

---

### 🧠 4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Uses **GLiNER** for advanced entity extraction.
- Identifies key entities such as:
  - **Persons**
  - **Organizations**
  - **Dates**
  - **Events**
  - Custom entities defined by the user.

---

### 🌩️ 5. Word Cloud Generator
- Provides a **visual representation** of frequently used words in the extracted text.
- Helps identify dominant themes and key ideas in large content.

---

### 🔥 6. Flexible User Interface
- Fully interactive **Gradio UI** for easy usage with buttons, controls, and visual outputs.
- Includes a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for advanced users who prefer terminal-based interactions.

---

## 🖥️ How to Use the Application

### 🚀 1. Gradio Interface (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Run the following command:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```

2. Access the interactive UI by visiting the displayed URL (e.g., `http://localhost:7860`).  
3. Follow these steps in the Gradio UI:
   - **Enter the URL** for the web article or PDF.
   - Click **"Fetch Text & Detect Language"**.
   - Optionally select:
     - **"TTS based on Summary"** or **"TTS based on Raw Data"** for audio generation.
     - Enable **Named Entity Recognition** for entity extraction.
   - Click **"Generate Audio"** or **"Extract Entities"** as desired.
4. The extracted text, metadata, summary, word cloud, and audio outputs will be displayed.

### 🚀 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
For advanced users who prefer terminal commands:
Below is the complete list of CLI commands that users can run for various functionalities in **VocalWeb**.

---

## 🔹 Basic Content Extraction (Default Behavior)
Generates:

✅ **Raw Cleaned Text**  
✅ **Metadata**  
✅ **Detected Language**  
✅ **Summary (Generated by Default)**  

```bash
python src/main.py --url "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedle6je601o"
```

---

## 🔹 Explicitly Request Summary (Optional)
⚠️ Summary is already generated by default, so this flag only acts as a **confirmation** for the user.

```bash
python src/main.py --url "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedle6je601o" --summarize
```

---

## 🔹 Generate Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Generates:

✅ Extracted Text  
✅ Metadata  
✅ Detected Language  
✅ Summary  
✅ **Named Entities**  

```bash
python src/main.py --url "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedle6je601o" --ner
```

---

## 🔹 Generate Word Cloud
Generates:

✅ Extracted Text  
✅ Metadata  
✅ Detected Language  
✅ Summary  
✅ **WordCloud saved as `.png`**  

```bash
python src/main.py --url "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedle6je601o" --wordcloud
```

---

## 🔹 Generate TTS (Text-to-Speech) Using Summary Text (Default)
Generates:

✅ Extracted Text  
✅ Metadata  
✅ Detected Language  
✅ Summary  
✅ **TTS Audio using the Summary Text**  

```bash
python src/main.py --url "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedle6je601o" --tts --tts-source summary
```

---

## 🔹 Generate TTS Using Raw Cleaned Text
Generates:

✅ Extracted Text  
✅ Metadata  
✅ Detected Language  
✅ Summary  
✅ **TTS Audio using Raw Cleaned Text**  

```bash
python src/main.py --url "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedle6je601o" --tts --tts-source raw
```

---

## 🔹 Full Feature Workflow (Recommended for Comprehensive Results)
Generates:

✅ Extracted Text  
✅ Metadata  
✅ Detected Language  
✅ Summary  
✅ Named Entities  
✅ WordCloud saved as `.png`  
✅ **TTS Audio using the Summary Text**  

```bash
python src/main.py --url "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedle6je601o" --summarize --ner --wordcloud --tts --tts-source summary
```

---

## 🔹 Full Feature Workflow Using Raw Text for TTS
Generates:

✅ Extracted Text  
✅ Metadata  
✅ Detected Language  
✅ Summary  
✅ Named Entities  
✅ WordCloud saved as `.png`  
✅ **TTS Audio using the Raw Cleaned Text**  

```bash
python src/main.py --url "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedle6je601o" --summarize --ner --wordcloud --tts --tts-source raw
```

---

## 🔹 TTS Only (Without Displaying Text)
Generates:

✅ **TTS Audio Only**  

```bash
python src/main.py --url "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedle6je601o" --tts
```

---

## 📝 Important Notes
- If `--tts-source summary` is used **without** the `--summarize` flag, the system will:
  - **Auto-generate the summary** (since it's done by default).
- If `--tts-source summary` is used but **summary generation fails**, the system will:
  - Display a **warning** and **fallback to raw text** for TTS.
