            "GPT-4 is a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. It exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. The report includes an extensive system card (after the Appendix) describing some of the risks weforesee around bias, disinformation, privacy, cybersecurity, proliferation, and more. A large focus of the GPT-4 project was building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The final loss of properly-trained large language models is thought to be well approximated by power.laws in the amount of compute used to train the model [41, 42, 2, 14, 15]. To verify the scalability of our optimization infrastructure, we predicted the final loss on our internal codebase (not part of the training set) with high accuracy. We registered predictions for GPT-4’s performance on HumanEval before training completed, using only information available prior to training. All but the 15 hardest humanEval problems were split into 6 difficulty buckets based on the performance of smaller models. The results on the 3rd easiest bucket are shown in Figure 2, showing that the resulting predictions were very accurate. Summarize: HF model for these exams. 4                 adababbagecuriegpt-3.5gpt-4Model050100AccuracyInverse scaling prize, hindsight neglect                 GPT-4 (no vision)                 Uniform Bar Exam (MBE+MEE+MPT) 4                    AdababbageCuriegpt 3. 5gpt -4Model 050100AccurateInverse Scale Prize, hindsight  neglect. GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on the majority of these professional and academic exams. It passes a simulated version of the Uniform Bar Examination with a score in the top 10% of test takers. The model’s capabilities on exams appear to stem primarily from the pre-training process and are not significantly affected by RLHF. GPT-4 substantially improves over previous models in the ability to follow user intent. On a dataset of 5,214 prompts submitted to ChatGPT and the OpenAI API, responses generated by GPT-3.5 were preferred on 70.2% of prompts. The model outperforms existing language models (Chinchilla  and PaLM ) for the majority of languages we tested. GPT-4 outperforms the English-language performance of existing language models [2, 3] for the vast majority of languages tested. The model generates text outputs consisting of arbitrarily interlaced text and images. Over a range of domains – includingdocuments with text and photographs, diagrams, or screenshots – GPT- 4 exhibits similar capabilities to text-only inputs. GPT-4 makes progress on public benchmarks like TruthfulQA, which tests the model’s ability to separate fact from an adversarially-selected set of incorrect statements. The pre-trained model is highly calibrated (its predicted confidence in an answer generally matches the probability of being correct) However, after the post-training process, the calibration is reduced (Figure 8) Anthropic-LM-Gpt-3.5-basegpt-4-turbogpt- 4-base gpt-40-shotRLHF0-shot5- shotRL HF0- shot5-shot. GPT-4 can be brittle on unsafe inputs as well assometimes exhibit undesired behaviors on both safe and unsafe inputs. GPT-4 produces toxic generations only 13% of the time, while GPT-3.5 generates toxic content 6%. Lower values of incorrect behavior on sensitive prompts are better compared to prior models. The RBRM takes three inputs: the prompt (optional), the output from the policy model, and a set of rules in multiple-choice style. . We are working with external researchers to improve our understanding of the potential impact of AI on society. We hope this article will help you understand more about the impact of technology on society and the world.
