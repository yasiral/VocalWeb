### ✅ Best Practices for Contributions
- **Use meaningful commit messages.** Avoid generic messages like `"Fixed bug"`; instead, write `"Fixed error in text extraction logic"`.
- **Write clear comments.** Help future contributors understand complex code.  
- **Follow the project structure.** Keep your files organized within the appropriate folders (e.g., `services/`, `config/`, `tests/`).  
- **Add tests.** If you're adding a new feature, write corresponding tests to ensure functionality.  
- **Respect existing code.** If refactoring is necessary, clearly justify your changes in the pull request.

### 🧪 Running Tests
Before submitting your contribution, ensure that all tests pass:

``` 
pytest tests/
```

1. Go to the **Issues** tab in the repository.  
2. Click **"New Issue"**.
